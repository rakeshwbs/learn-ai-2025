### Lesson 1 - Introduction to AI

##### ðŸŸ¥ What is AI?

  AI can be defined as the simulation of human intelligence by **machines**. 

##### ðŸŸ¨Training

 The process of learning from data is called training.

ðŸŸ© Two fundamental approaches of AI

1. Discriminative AI
2. Generative AI

#####   Discriminative AI

- Discriminative AI is an approach that learns to distinguish between different classes of data.
- Discriminative AI models learn the **boundary** between classes. They aim to **predict a label given an input**, i.e., they estimate the **conditional probability** P(y|x), where y is the label and x is the input data.

> ##### **Purpose:**
>
> To **differentiate** between different categories of data.

- A discriminative AI model is given a set of training data, where each data point is labeled with its class. 

- The model then predicts the class of a new data point by finding the side of the decision boundary that the data point falls on.

- Discriminative AI models use advanced algorithms to differentiate, classify, identify patterns and draw conclusions based on training data

**Example of Discriminative AI**

- One example of how a discriminative AI model works can be seen in how email spam filters can differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.

##### Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), standard Neural Networks.
